        <p>
          Every student, who is pursuing degree in Computer Science, at some
          point has to take a course about <strong>algorithms</strong>. One of
          the most crutial topic of that class is <strong>sorting</strong> of
          <strong>data structures</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For some of my classmates it was really had to understand how
          different algorithms work. Luckily, our instructor had visualizations
          for most of the sorting algorithms, which made lifes of my classmates
          much easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          For that reason, I decided to bring all of the sorting algorithms in
          one place. Here, you can learn everything you need about each one of
          them. Interactive visualizations will help you to understand each
          algorithm in a great details. Moreover, you can even try to inplement
          that algorithm in our live interactive console.
